  error2:
  Scala IDE complains about ‘... is cross-compiled with an incompatible version of Scala ...’
The Scala IDE tries to check if binary incompatible Scala libraries have been inadvertently mixed in a project’s classpath. It works by extracting, from the name of the jars, which major version of Scala it has been compiled against (assuming the Scala convention for publishing cross-compiled libraries, and further assuming that Scala minor releases are binary compatible). If the extracted Scala major version doesn’t match the one bundled with the Scala IDE, a problem is reported. This ad-hoc validation prevents one of the most common reason for compiler crashes and lack of intelligent behavior in the Scala IDE.

If this check returns a false-negative, it can be disabled at the workspace level, or at the project level. The setting is withVersionClasspathValidator in the Scala → Compiler → Build Manager preference section.
